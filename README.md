# Rock Paper Scissors
This is a classic game well know by everybody. I've been focused on implementing JavaScript code, adding interactivity to my buttons. The rule is to defeat the computer by choosing on of the three images (a rock, a paper and some scissors). Rock beats scissors, scissors cut paper, paper beats rock. 

I wanted to make it a bit harder by adding the thumbnails which shows what every players chosed

## Features

1 -- The main objects of the game (my hands). Three buttons (left - rock, middle - paper, right - scissors) <br>
2 -- The result represented by two small thumbnails. My choice vs. computer's choices. <br>
3 -- The outputs represented by: a text calling the winner, a text representing competitors choices, a text that numbers the winns, losses and ties throughout the game <br>
4 -- Two features which add a bit of complexity to the game: Autoplay, my choices being chosen randomly by the computer. One reset button which resets the score whenever we press the button. <br>

## Lessons Learned

The main lesson was to understand how a function works, how to work with events, how to call a function when a specific button is clicked.

I've implemented the for loop, displayed some arrays, I've used DOM for the first time, in order to access and change the elements from the main HTML page.

## Optimizations

It was a good starting point to understand some of the main concepts of JavaScript, to display some simple functions and give my page a bit of dynamism.
