# Rock Paper Scissors
This is a classic game well know by everybody. I've been focused on implementing JavaScript code, adding interactivity to my buttons. The rule is to defeat the computer by choosing on of the three images (a rock, a paper and some scissors). Rock beats scissors, scissors cut paper, paper beats rock. 

I wanted to make it a bit harder by adding the thumbnails which shows what every players chosed

## Features

- A placeholder to enter the to do things
- Start and end dates options
- One interactive green Add button to be pressed after choosing the actual to do thing and dates
- One interactive red Delete button in case we want to delete one of the rows
- The newKeyDown event which let us press Enter after typing the event, which will proceed the same as the green Add Button

## Lessons Learned

The main lesson was to understand how a function works, how to work with events, how to call a function when a specific button is clicked.

I've implemented the for loop, displayed some arrays, I've used DOM for the first time, in order to access and change the elements from the main HTML page.

## Optimizations

It was a good starting point to understand some of the main concepts of JavaScript, to display some simple functions and give my page a bit of dynamism.
